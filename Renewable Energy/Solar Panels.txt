- solar panels are great specially suitable for in-city or suburban housing
- no noise at all
- a 5 kw/h panel can power an average american house
- cheap.
- value-to-money is very good
- can not be shut down by lightening and extreme wind.
- maintainance is cheap, with a 25 year gurantee period.
- very brilliant idea in countries like Egypt with lots of solar power in place.
- not a very good choice for large scale power production.
